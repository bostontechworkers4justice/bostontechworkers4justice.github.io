## About Boston Tech Workers For Justice 

Boston Tech Workers for Justice (BTWJ), a democratically run all-volunteer committee of Massachusetts Jobs with Justice, is a group of tech workers and allies in the Boston area committed to organizing for social justice and better conditions in our workplaces and communities. We work in solidarity with existing labor organizations, mutual aid groups, and other groups of tech workers. 

## Current Projects 

- **Equitable Employment**: Together with partners at [Resilient Coders](https://medium.com/@delmarsenties/how-to-organize-for-equitable-employment-at-your-tech-company-8e2a07c497aa), we are working to support tech workers in pushing for racial justice in the workplace.

- **Workplace Organizing Trainings**: BTWJ periodically hosts training sessions with guest trainers to hone our organizing skills.

- **Tech Open Office Hours**: We host open office hours for nonprofits and community members to come together and discuss projects and tech needs
