## About Boston Tech Workers For Justice 

Boston Tech Workers for Justice (BTWJ), a democratically run all-volunteer committee of Massachusetts Jobs with Justice, is a group of tech workers and allies in the Boston area committed to organizing for social justice and better conditions in our workplaces and communities. We work in solidarity with existing labor organizations, mutual aid groups, and other groups of tech workers. 

## Current Projects 

- Building Data: COVID-19 has many tech workers working from home, but the building staff who work beside us every day cannot telecommute. We are currently gathering data to share with Jobs with Justice coalition members to make connections between tech workers and building workers who work in the same place. 

- Workplace Organizing Trainings: BTWJ periodically hosts training sessions with guest trainers to hone our organizing skills.

- Workplace Transparency Pledge: BTWJ created a workplace transparency pledge to place pressure on our employers to improve working conditions. 

- Tech Open Office Hours: We host open office hours for nonprofits and community members to come together and discuss projects and tech needs
